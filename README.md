# A_FurryTale
Animatronic tail design, Final Year Project for UCT 2023. 

# Abstract
Cosplay is an activity whereby enthusiasts create costumes to represent themselves as characters from their favourite fantasy media. The Furry community, a sub-genre of this community, creates complex and elaborate costumes that cost thousands of dollars to represent themselves as animals or fantasy creatures. These anthropomorphic animal characters often sport tails as a crucial element to the costumes. While most of the other parts of these costumes are widely available, there is a notable lack of wearable animatronic tails. 

The problem therefore that this project set out to address is the notable lack of wearable animatronic tails in the Furry community, despite the clear demand and market for such tails. This project is a design journey to create a lightweight, comfortable, wearable animatronic tail. This tail should be able to mimic the natural movement of an animal tail and sit comfortably on the wearer. 

This project took place over 12 weeks, with a strict budget of R2000. The project's core work was carried out through the design and testing of multiple tail mechanisms. These mechanisms were evaluated to determine the most suitable one, which was then advanced in the design process. A mechanism for holding and actuating the tail, along with the essential software, was also developed.

Eventually, all subsystems were integrated to create the final tail design which met the project's objectives. This report details this design journey, marking the successful development of a lightweight, comfortable, wearable animatronic tail.
